# MR.js

An extendable WebComponents library for the Spatial Web

## Overview

MR.js is a Mixed Reality first, webXR UI library meant to bootstrap spatial web app development. It implements much of the foundational work so that developers can spend less time on the basics and more time on their app.

# Features

## 2D UI & Layout Components

```html
<mr-app>
    <mr-container width="3" height="2">
        <mr-row>
            <mr-panel>
                This is a quick example of an image gallery with explainer text.
            </mr-panel>
            <mr-column>
                <-- image tag not yet implemented -->
                <mr-image src="..."></mr-image>
                <mr-row height="0.02">
                    <-- Buttons not yet implemented -->
                    <mr-button onClick="Prev()"> <- </mr-button>
                    <mr-button onClick="Next()"> -> </mr-button>
                </mr-row>
            </mr-column>
        </mr-row>
    </mr-container>
</mr-app>
```

## 3D Layout

```html
<mr-app>
    <mr-volume>
        <mr-panel snap-to="top">
                This panel snaps to the top of the volume
        </mr-panel>
        <mr-panel snap-to="right">
                This panel snaps to the right of the volume
        </mr-panel>
        <mr-panel snap-to="bottom">
                This panel snaps to the bottom of the volume
        </mr-panel>
        <mr-panel snap-to="left">
                This panel snaps to the left of the volume
        </mr-panel>
    </mr-volume>
</mr-app>
```

## Hand Interaction

(touch and point/pinch interaction is currently disabled while transitioning to physics based gestures)

## 3D Content

_**Currently unimplemented but here's the markup**_

```html
<mr-app>
    <mr-volume>
        <mr-panel snap-to="left">
            This is an example of loading a 3D model
        </mr-panel>
        <mr-cube opacity="0.3">
            <mr-model src="model.gltf"></mr-model>
        </mr-cube>
    </mr-volume>
<mr-app>
```
## Built-in Physics Engine

Rapier.js is fully integrated out of the box. We use it to power collision based hand-interactions, but ot also support other common features such as:

- Gravity
- Rag doll physics
- Joint constraints
- Vehicles
- Complex collision shapes
- Kinematics

## Extendable

Built on top of THREE.js & WebComponents, and a built in ECS, MR.js provides a familiar interface to create custom Elements that can be reused through out your app.

### ECS

MR.js is designed from the ground up using the Entity-Component-System Architecture. This is a common architecture implemented by Game Engines such as Unity, Unreal, and Apple's RealityKit.

#### Entity

an Entity is an object. It stores only the most fundamental data, such as a unique identifier, a THREE.js Object3D, a physics body, and dimension data such as width and scale.

Any `mr-*` tag within the `mr-app` is an Entity. `mr-entity` is the spatial equivalent of a `div`.

Creating a custom Entity is as simple as creating a Custom Element via the WebComponents API.

Example:

```js
class Spacecraft extends Entity {
    constructor(){
        this.object3D = this.generateSpacecraft()
    }

    // function to procedurally generate a 3D spacecraft
    generateSpacecraft(){
        ...
    }
}

customElements.get('mr-spacecraft') || customElements.define('mr-spacecraft', Spacecraft)
```

#### Components

Components are attached to entities and used to store data. in MR.js they are implemented using attributes beginning with the prefix `comp-`.

Example:

```html
<mr-spacecraft comp-orbit="radius: 0.5; target: #user;"></mr-spacecraft>
```

#### Systems

A System contains logic that is applied all entities that have a corresponding Component, using the data stored by the component. unlike Entities & Components, Systems have no HTML representation and are implemented entirely in JS.

When a component is attached or detached from an entity, it is added or removed from its System's registry of entities

Example:

```js
class OrbitSystem extends System{
    constructor(){
        super()
    }

    // called every frame
    update(deltaTime, frame) {
        for(const entity in this.registry) {
            // Update entity position
        }
    }

    // Called when an orbit component is attached
    attachedComponent(entity, data) {
        ...
    }


    // do something when an orbit component is updated
    updatedComponent(entity, data) {
        ...
    }

    // do something when an orbit component is detatched
    detachedComponent(entity) {
        ...
    }
}
```

Note: the mapping between components and systems is 1-to-1, and the naming convention (`comp-<name>` and `<Name>System`) is strictly enforced. components can only be modified by their matching system. You can also implement a System to do per frame logic without using components, but it's not recommended.
